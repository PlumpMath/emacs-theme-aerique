## Extra Files

These are some extra files that will add similar colors to other
programs.  Vim will look somewhat similar and the other main things
are green and red for diff additions and yellow for highlights.

These files still contain a lot of my personal preferences that
have nothing to do with colors so be careful when cutting and
pasting.

It is discouraged (for now) to use these files directly.
