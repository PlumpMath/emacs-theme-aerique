# Emacs Theme: aerique

Theme centered on minimal syntax highlighting and distinct but not too
harsh or distracting colors.  The only active font-lock faces are:
builtin, comment and string.

The point of this theme is not highlighting all kinds of different syntax
but partitioning the source code in easily scannable pieces.")
